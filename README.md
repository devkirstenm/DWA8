# 📚 Book Connect Abstraction Challenge

## Challenge Objective ✨

In this module, the challenge was to further iterate on the "Book Connect" codebase by creating an encapsulated abstraction of the book preview by means of a single factory function.

## Application

Created a single factory function that generates book preview elements of the book preview.

The function takes the necessary parameters to construct the book preview, such as the author, ID, image and title. Inside the factory function, the book preview element was created and then returned.

## User Stories 📖

- As a user, I want to view a list of book previews, by title and author, so that I can discover new books to read.
- As a user, I want an image associated with all book previews so that I can recognize a book by the cover even if I forgot the name.
- As a user, I want to have the option of reading a summary of the book so that I can decide whether I want to read it.
- As a user, I want to have the option of seeing the date that a book was published so that I can determine how easy it is to obtain second-hand.
- As a user, I want to find books based on specific text phrases so that I don’t need to remember the entire title of a book.
- As a user, I want to filter books by author so that I can find books to read by authors that I enjoy.
- As a user, I want to filter books by genre so that I can find books to read in genres that I enjoy.
- As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light modes so that I can use the app comfortably at night.
